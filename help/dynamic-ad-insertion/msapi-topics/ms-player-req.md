* Can request tracking URLs at the times specified. 
* Runs on a device platform that supports HLS v3 or later, including:

    * PTS discontinuities as marked by `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` tags
    * `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE`
    * `EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME`
    * `EXT-X-START`

* Runs on a platform that supports HTTP redirects and parsing JSON.
* Runs on a platform that supports CORS.
