# MediaPlayer and MediaResource classes{#mediaplayer-and-mediaresource-classes}

A MediaResource represents the content that is about to be loaded by the MediaPlayer instance.

The TVSDK library provides a simple means to load and prepare content for playback by using the `replaceCurrentResource` method in the `MediaPlayer` interface. This method receives an instance of the `MediaResource` class as the sole input argument. The `MediaResource` class is composed of the following information:

* A URL, which represents the location of the content that is about to be loaded. 
* A type, which is the type of content that is about to be loaded.

  This is a string that defines the types of content that can be loaded by the `MediaPlayer`. Possible values are HLS and HDS. Each value is associated with the string representing the file extensions commonly used, “m3u8” for HLS and “f4m” for HDS. 
* Some metadata, which is an instance of the `Metadata` class.

  This dictionary-like structure might contain additional information about the content that is about to be loaded, such as information about the alternate/ad content that should be placed in the main content.

The metadata is the medium through which information that is related to alternate content is passed to TVSDK. The `Metadata` interface defines the API for a generic key-value store, where both the key and the value are plain strings.
