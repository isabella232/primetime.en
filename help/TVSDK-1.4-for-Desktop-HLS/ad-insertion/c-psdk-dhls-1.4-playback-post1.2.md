# Default and customized playback behavior with ads{#default-and-customized-playback-behavior-with-ads}

The behavior of media playback is affected by seeking, pausing, fast forward or rewind (trick play mode), and the inclusion of advertising.

To override the default behavior, use `AdPolicySelector`.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>TVSDK does not provide a way to disable seeking during ads. Adobe recommends that you configure your application to disable seeking during ads.

The following table describes how TVSDK handles ads and ad breaks during playback:
