# Order of playback events{#order-of-playback-events}

TVSDK dispatches events/notifications in generally expected sequences. Your player can implement actions based on events in the expected sequence.

<a id="section_6E34A6C7936245D88DEB3315DA64598B"></a>

The following examples show the order of some events that include playback events.

* When successfully loading a media resource through `MediaPlayer.replaceCurrentResource`, the order of events is:

    * `MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent.STATUS_CHANGED` with status `MediaPlayerStatus.INITIALIZING` 
    
    * `MediaPlayerItemEvent.ITEM_CREATED` 
    * `MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent.STATUS_CHANGED` with status `MediaPlayerStatus.INITIALIZED`

* When preparing for playback through `MediaPlayer.prepareToPlay`, the order of events is:

    * `MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent.STATUS_CHANGED` with status `MediaPlayerStatus.PREPARING` 
    
    * `TimelineEvent.TIMELINE_UPDATED` if ads were inserted 
    * `MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent.STATUS_CHANGED` with status `MediaPlayerStatus.PREPARED`

* For live/linear streams, during playback as the playback window advances and additional opportunities are resolved, the order of events is:

    * `MediaPlayerItemEvent.ITEM_UPDATED` 
    * `TimelineEvent.TIMELINE_UPDATED` if ads were inserted

The following example shows a typical progression of events:

```
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(MediaPlayerItemEvent.ITEM_CREATED, onItemCreated); 
public function onItemCreated(event:MediaPlayerItemEvent):void { 
    var item:MediaPlayerItem = event.item; 
    ... 
} 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(MediaPlayerItemEvent.ITEM_UPDATED, onItemUpdated); 
public function onItemUpdated(event:MediaPlayerItemEvent):void { 
    var item:MediaPlayerItem = event.item; 
    ... 
} 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent.STATUS_CHANGED,  
                             onStatusChanged); 
public function onStatusChanged(event:MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent):void { 
    switch(event.status){ 
        case MediaPlayerStatus.INITIALIZING: 
        case MediaPlayerStatus.INITIALIZED: 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(TimeChangeEvent.TIME_CHANGED, onTimeChanged); 
public function onTimeChanged(event:TimeChangeEvent):void { 
    var timeInMilliseconds:Number = event.time; 
    ... 
}
```
