# Catalog format{#catalog-format}

The Primetime reference implementation uses a JSON-based feed format for responses. This format is parsed using an implementation of the IFeedItemAdapter interface.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feed format is the sample format that the reference implementation uses and serves as an example of how the format can be parsed and mapped to the feed interface. You can use your own input feed format with your own feed interface implementations.

At a high-level, the format consists of an array of content entries. Each entry represents a live or VOD published video content:

```
{
    "entries": [
        {
        },
        {
        },
        ...
    ]
}

```

Each feed entry is a JSON object with a given set of attributes:

```
{
    "entries": [
        
            "id": "episode1",
            "title": "My episode1",
            "description": "This is an episode.",
            "categories": "documentary, educational, children",
            "keywords": "List, of, comma, separated, keywords",
            "isLive": false,
            "content":  [
                
                },
                
                },
            ],
            "thumbnails": [
                
                },
                
                }
            ]
            "metadata": 
            } 
        }
    ]
