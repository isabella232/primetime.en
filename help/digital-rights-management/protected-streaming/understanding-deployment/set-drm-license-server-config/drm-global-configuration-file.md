# Global configuration file{#global-configuration-file}

The flashaccess-global.xml configuration file includes settings that apply to all tenants of the license server.

You must place the configuration file in the [!DNL LicenseServer.ConfigRoot] directory.

See the [!DNL configs] directory for an example of a global configuration file.

The global configuration file includes:

* Caching — Controls caching of config files in memory.

  See *Updating configuration files* for information about the caching settings. 
* Logging — Specifies the logging level and how frequently log files are rolled. 
* HSM password — Required only if an HSM is used to store server credentials.

See comments in the example global configuration file that is located in [!DNL Primetime DRM <DVD>\Adobe Primetime DRM Server for Protected Streaming\configs] for more details.
