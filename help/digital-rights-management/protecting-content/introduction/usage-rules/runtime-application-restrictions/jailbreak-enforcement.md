# Jailbreak enforcement (requires Adobe Primetime DRM){#jailbreak-enforcement-requires-adobe-primetime-drm}

>This usage rule is supported by Adobe Primetime DRM client version 4.0 or later. However, it has no effect on platforms that do not support jailbreak detection. The behavior on older clients depends on the minimum client version supported by the license server.
