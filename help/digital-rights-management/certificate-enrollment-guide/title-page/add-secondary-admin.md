# Create a Secondary Administrator{#create-a-secondary-administrator}

The Account Administrator can create a Secondary Administrator. There can be only one Secondary Administrator. The Account Administrator can promote the Secondary Administrator to Account Administrator. This action demotes the Account Administrator to the role of Secondary Administrator. 

1. The Account Administrator logs on to the Certificate Enrollment site with a valid Adobe ID that contains the domain name of the licensee.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL User accounts]** tab, do one of the following:
