# Subscription{#subscription}

Some services offer paid subscriptions that give users unlimited access to a large library of content for as long as they continue to pay the monthly fees. The license server issues a unique license for each piece of content and also issues a root license whose expiration coincides with the subscription period. Each month, when the user renews his subscription, the root license can also be renewed. When requesting a license, the user needs to authenticate so the server can verify that the user's subscription is up to date.
