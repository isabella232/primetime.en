# Develop applications for video playback{#develop-applications-for-video-playback}

To enable consumers to access and view content, develop a video playback application using Flash Player or Adobe AIR. Once you developed a video playback application, you must deploy it to consumers. If you are developing an application using Flash Player, host it on your organization’s website. If you are developing an application using Adobe® AIR®, post the AIR application installer so that consumers can download and install the application on their computer.

To learn more about developing custom video playback applications for use with Adobe Primetime DRM, see the “Working with Video” chapter in [ActionScript 3.0 Developer Guide](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/dev/WS9936fa0d5984e93b3f4f38ec1272a447844-8000.html)*, *the [Adobe Video Technology Center](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/video/), and the [Open Source Media Framework](http://www.opensourcemediaframework.com/).
