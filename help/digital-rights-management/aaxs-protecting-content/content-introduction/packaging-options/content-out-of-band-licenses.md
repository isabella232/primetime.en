# Out-of-band Licenses{#out-of-band-licenses}

Using Adobe Access 3.0 Professional, it is possible to implement a workflow in which the clients obtain pre-generated licenses out-of-band, eliminating the need to deploy a license server. To support this workflow, an option indicating that no license server is available should be specified at packaging time. This will prevent the Adobe Access client from attempting to request a license for this content from a license server.

Content which indicates the no license server is available, can only be played on Adobe Access clients version 3.0 and higher. Older clients would need to upgrade in order to play this content.
