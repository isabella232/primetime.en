# Output protection controls{#output-protection-controls}

** Control whether output to external rendering devices is protected. Specify analog and digital outputs independently.**

Controls whether output to external rendering devices should be restricted. An external device is defined as any video or audio device that is not embedded in the computer. The list of external devices excludes integrated displays, such as in notebook computers. Analog and digital output restrictions can be specified independently.

The following options/levels of enforcement are available:

For instance, an attempt will be made by the Adobe Access client to enable either ACP or CGMS-A. If the attempt succeeds, the other option will not be enabled.

>While these rules are consistently enforced across all platforms, currently it is only possible to securely turn on output protection on Windows platforms. On other platforms (such as Macintosh and Linux) there are no supporting operating system functions available to third party applications.

Example use case: Some content might enforce output protection controls, and the level of protection can be set by the content distributor. If “Required” is specified and playback is attempted on a Macintosh, the client does not play back content on external devices. The content will, however, play back on internal monitors.

If “Required” is specified and playback is attempted on Linux, the client does not play back content on any devices because it is not possible to differentiate between internal and external devices.

If you specify “Use if available”, output protection is turned on where possible. For example, on Windows machines that support the Certified Output Protection Protocol (COPP), the content is passed with output protection to an external display. This example is sometimes known as “selectable output control”.
