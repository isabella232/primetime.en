# Physical security and access{#physical-security-and-access}

Physically securing your Adobe Primetime DRM environment is crucial to preventing unauthorized access.

The physical security of your Primetime DRM environment can range from the server being placed in a secure room under lock and key to being in a secured alarmed cage that is isolated from other computers, has a two-part authentication, such as badge and fingerprint, and is monitored continuously by Closed Circuit Television (CCTV). The degree of security that you implement depends on your organization's policies, the potential of loss and severity if a badge or key were lost, and other legal compliance requirements.

Your Primetime DRM environment should be in a secure server room where access is electronically controlled with at least a card reader. The room should be alarmed and monitored by security or someone who will respond rapidly to a breach or incident and all access is continuously recorded on CCTV. Your security team must always know who is in the room and when these people entered the room. If the server room is large, and a lot of people have access, the server must be in a secure cage or rack to limit further access.

To implement an extremely high level of security, the protection must extend to the power supply, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), network equipment, and other related equipment. Disruptions to these items affects the server, especially if the server must be up and running at all times. There must be two-part access, such as badge and PIN or badge and fingerprint. Also, anti-tailgating devices must be installed on the door to prevent authorized people from allowing unauthorized people to enter.
