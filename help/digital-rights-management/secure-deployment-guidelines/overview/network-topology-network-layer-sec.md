# Network layer security{#network-layer-security}

Network security vulnerabilities are among the first threats to any Internet-facing or intranet-facing application server, and you must harden hosts on the network against these vulnerabilities.

Here are some common techniques that reduce network security vulnerabilities:

You must separate the external network from the DMZ that includes the web servers, and the web servers must be separated from the internal network. You can use firewalls to implement these layers of separation. </p> <p>You can categorize and control the traffic that passes through each network layer to ensure that only the absolute minimum of required data is allowed. </p> </td>
