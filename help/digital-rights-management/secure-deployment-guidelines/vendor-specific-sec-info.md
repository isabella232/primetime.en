# Vendor-specific security information{#vendor-specific-security-information}

Operating systems and application servers are included in your Adobe Primetime DRM solution.

To find vendor-specific security information for your operating system and application server, see Using the Adobe Primetime DRM Key Server.

## Operating system security information {#section_53CAD802FCA54C4D8CE0C4E1B3045E52}

When securing your operating system, you must implement the measures that are described by your operating system vendor.

Here are some of the measures:

* Defining and controlling users, roles, and privileges 
* Monitoring logs and audit trails 
* Removing unnecessary services and applications 
* Backing up files

Here is some information about the operating systems that are supported by Adobe Primetime DRM:
