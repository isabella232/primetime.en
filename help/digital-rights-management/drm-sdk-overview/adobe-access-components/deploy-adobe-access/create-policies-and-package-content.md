# Create policies and package content{#create-policies-and-package-content}

Using the usage rules supported by the SDK, you must define and create policies in support of your organization’s business model, and then package your content using those policies. Once policies are applied to content during packaging, you can maintain control of your content no matter how widely it is distributed.

The policies in Adobe Primetime DRM support a wide range of different usage rules, including:

* Specifying the number of days a license is valid once a consumer begins watching the content. 
* Allowing license caching. 
* Specifying client runtimes and versions that can access content (for example, users must have a certain Adobe AIR application or a specific version of Flash Player). 
* Requiring that consumers authenticate themselves using a username and password prior to viewing protected content, or allowing anonymous access.

To learn more about packaging content, see *Protecting Content*. To learn more about the usage rules and the business models they support, see *Usage Rules*.
