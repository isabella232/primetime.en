# Adobe AIR{#adobe-air}

Adobe AIR is a cross-operating system runtime that allows content producers to extend their existing investments in the web to the desktop by designing customized multimedia applications. Built on proven, open technologies, it provides a reliable, simplified way for businesses to develop and deploy custom applications that can be trusted to deliver a more secure, enjoyable user experience. Adobe AIR allows businesses to easily integrate rich media to create a more immersive and interactive user experience. It lets developers use familiar tools such as HTML, JavaScript, Flash, or Adobe® Flex® software to deploy their unique combination of rich Internet applications to either Windows, Macintosh, or Linux.

Businesses have complete control of the user interface, and they can design a user experience to reflect and reinforce their brand. With built-in support for playback of content protected with Adobe Primetime DRM SDK, Adobe AIR helps create custom, end-to-end content distribution chains.
