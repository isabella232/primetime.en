Primetime DRM SDK is a digital rights management platform that makes it possible to protect and securely deliver video and audio content for playback on consumer devices.

Primetime DRM is a flexible platform that enables content owners to protect their content and maintain control over distribution. Content owners can protect and manage their rights by creating licenses for each digital media file, ensuring that a wide variety of the highest-quality content is made available to consumers.

Primetime DRM supports a wide range of business models, including video on demand, rental, and electronic sell-through. You can distribute content protected with Primetime DRM in a variety of ways, including:

* Streaming through Adobe Flash Media Server software 
* Offering progressive download via HTTP using Adobe's HTTP Dynamic Streaming technology 
* Permitting downloads to a content library for local playback at the consumer's convenience
