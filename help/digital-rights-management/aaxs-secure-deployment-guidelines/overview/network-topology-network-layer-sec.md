# Network layer security{#network-layer-security}

Network security vulnerabilities are among the first threats to any Internet-facing or intranet-facing application server. This section describes the process of hardening hosts on the network against these vulnerabilities. It addresses network segmentation, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack hardening, and the use of firewalls for host protection.

This table describes common techniques that reduce network security vulnerabilities.

Separate the external network from the DMZ that contains the web servers, which in turn must be separated from the internal network. Use firewalls to implement the layers of separation. Categorize and control the traffic that passes through each network layer to ensure that only the absolute minimum of required data is allowed. </p> </td>
