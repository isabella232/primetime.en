# Vendor-specific security information{#vendor-specific-security-information}

This section contains security-related information about operating systems and application servers that are incorporated into your Adobe Access solution.

Use the links provided in this section to find vendor-specific security information for your operating system and application server.

## Operating system security information {#section-B6D9D6CEA7CC42A8A20346600EFB5E4E}

When securing your operating system, carefully implement the measures that are described by your operating system vendor, including these:

* Defining and controlling users, roles, and privileges 
* Monitoring logs and audit trails 
* Removing unnecessary services and applications 
* Backing up files

For security information about operating systems that Adobe Access supports, see the resources in this table.
