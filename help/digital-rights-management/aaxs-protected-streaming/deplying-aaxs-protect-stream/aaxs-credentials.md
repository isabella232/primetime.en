# Adobe Access credentials {#adobe-access-credentials}

To issue valid licenses accepted by a Adobe Access client, the Adobe Access Server for Protected Streaming must be configured with a set of credentials issued by Adobe. These credentials can either be stored in PKCS#12 (.pfx) files or on an HSM.

The .pfx files may be located anywhere, but for ease of configuration, we recommend placing the .pfx files in the tenant's configuration directory. For more information, see "[License server configuration files](../../aaxs-protected-streaming/aaxs-license-server-config-files/aaxs-configuration-directory-structure.md)".
