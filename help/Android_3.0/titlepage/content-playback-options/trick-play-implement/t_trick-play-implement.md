# Implement fast forward and rewind

When users fast forward or fast rewind through the media, they are in the trick play mode. To enter trick play mode, set the MediaPlayer playback rate to a value other than 1.

To switch the speed, you must set one value. 

1. Move from normal play mode (1x) to trick play mode by setting the rate on the `MediaPlayer` to an allowed value.

       Remember the following information:     
    * The `MediaPlayerItem` class defines the allowed playback rates.    
    * TVSDK selects the closest allowed rate if the specified rate is not allowed.    
    

    
       The following example sets the player's internal playback rate to the requested rate:     
       ```
       import com.adobe.mediacore.MediaPlayer; 
       import com.adobe.mediacore.MediaPlayerItem; 
       import com.adobe.mediacore.MediaPlayerException; 
       import java.util.List; 
       import java.lang.Float; 
        
       private boolean setPlaybackRate(MediaPlayer player, float rate)  
         throws MediaPlayerException { 
           // Get list of playback rates that the media player supports 
           MediaPlayerItem item = player.getCurrentItem(); 
           if (item == null) return false; 
           List<Float> availableRates = player.getCurrentItem().getAvailablePlaybackRates(); 
        
           // Return false if requested rate is not supported 
           if (availableRates.indexOf(rate) == -1) return false; 
        
           // Otherwise set the playback rate to the requested rate  
           // (this can throw MediaPlayerException) 
           player.setRate(rate); 
           return true; 
       }
       ```

    
1. You can optionally listen for rate-change events, which notifies you when you requested a rate change and when the rate change actually occurs.

       TVSDK dispatches the following events that are related to trick play:     
    * `MediaPlayerEvent.RATE_SELECTED`, when the `rate` value changes to a different value.    
    * `MediaPlayerEvent.RATE_PLAYING`, when playback resumes at the selected rate.    
    
    
       TVSDK dispatches these events when the player returns from trick play mode to normal play mode.
