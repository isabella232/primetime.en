# Access alternate audio tracks

Alternate audio uses MediaPlayer to play a video that is specified in an M3U8 HLS playlist and that can contain several alternate audio streams.


1. Wait for the `MediaPlayer` to be in at least the `MediaPlayerStatus.PREPARED` status.
1. Listen for the `MediaPlayerEvent.STATUS_CHANGED` event with status `MediaPlayerStatus.PREPARED`.

   This step means that the initial list of audio tracks is available. 

1. Get the available audio tracks from the `MediaPlayerItem` instance.

   ```
   java   mediaPlayerItem.getAudioTracks()
   ```

1. (Optional) Present the available tracks to the user.
1. Set the selected audio track on the `MediaPlayerItem` instance.

   ```
   java   mediaPlayerItem.selectAudioTrack(audioTrack)
   ```
