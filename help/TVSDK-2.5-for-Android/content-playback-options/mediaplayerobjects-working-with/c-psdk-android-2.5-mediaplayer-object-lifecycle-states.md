# Lifecycle and statuses of the MediaPlayer object{#lifecycle-and-statuses-of-the-mediaplayer-object}

The status of the media player determines which actions are legal.

For working with media player statuses:

* You can retrieve the current status of the `MediaPlayer` object with `MediaPlayer.getStatus()`. 

* The list of statuses is defined in the [MediaPlayerStatus](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/javadoc_2.5/com/adobe/mediacore/MediaPlayerStatus.html) enum.

The following table provides details about the lifecycle and statuses of the media player:

>[!TIP]
>
>You can use the status to provide feedback on the process, or example, a spinner while waiting for the next status change, or take the next steps in playing the media, such as waiting for the appropriate status before calling the next method.

For example: 

```java
mediaPlayer.addEventListener(MediaPlayerEvent STATUS_CHANGED, new StatusChangeEventListener() { 
    @Override  
    public void onStatusChanged(MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent event) { 
        switch(event.getStatus()) { 
            case INITIALIZED: 
                mediaPlayer.prepareToPlay(); 
                break; 
            case PREPARING: 
                showBufferingSpinner(); 
                break; 
            case PREPARED: 
                hideBufferingSpinner(); 
                mediaPlayer.play(); 
                break; 
            ...                
        } 
        ... 
    } 
}); 

```
