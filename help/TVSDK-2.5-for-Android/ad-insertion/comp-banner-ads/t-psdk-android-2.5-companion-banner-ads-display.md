# Display banner ads{#display-banner-ads}

To display banner ads, you need to create banner instances and allow TVSDK to listen for ad-related events.

TVSDK provides a list of companion banner ads that are associated with a linear ad through the `AdPlaybackEventListener.onAdBreakStart` event.

Manifests can specify companion banner ads by:

* An HTML snippet 
* The URL of an iFrame page 
* The URL of a static image or an Adobe Flash SWF file

For each companion ad, TVSDK indicates which types are available for your application. 

1. Add a listener for the `AdPlaybackEventListener.onAdBreakStart` event that does the following:

    * Clears existing ads in the banner instance. 
    * Gets the list of companion ads from `Ad.getCompanionAssets`. 
    * If the list of companion ads is not empty, iterate over the list for banner instances.

      Each banner instance (an `AdAsset`) contains information, such as width, height, resource type (html, iframe, or static), and data that is required to display the companion banner. 
    * If a video ad has no companion ads booked with it, the list of companion assets contains no data for that video ad. 
    * To show a standalone display ad, add the logic to your script to run a normal DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers) display ad tag in the appropriate banner instance. 
    * Sends the banner information to a function on your page that displays the banners in an appropriate location.

      This is usually a `div`, and your function uses the `div ID` to display the banner.
