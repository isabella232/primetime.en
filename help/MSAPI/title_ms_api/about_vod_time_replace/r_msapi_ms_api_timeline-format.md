# VOD timeline format

You can specify or override timelines for ad breaks in VOD content using a formatted list of ad and content segments called pods.


## Pods {#section_606E9456E25E41C8B8537A023DDD96CE}

A pod is an ad break or a content segment. A timeline consists of a sequence of pods, separated by semicolons. The following types of pods exist: 

* ** Ad break ** 
  ```
  B,duration,maximum_number_of_ads,position
  ```
  Duration is in seconds, with precision of .001 (milliseconds); number of ads is an integer. Position is one of the following: 
    * ** `n` ** None — no ad 
    
    * ** `p` ** Pre-roll — before the content 
    
    * ** `m` ** Mid-roll — within the content 
    
    * ** `t` ** Post-roll — after the content 
    
    
    
  For example, `B,60,2,p` represents a one-minute break for up to 2 ads before the content. 


* ** Content segment (chapter) ** 
  ```
  C,duration,number_of_lots
  ```
  Duration is in seconds, with precision of .001 (milliseconds); number of lots (sections of content) is an integer. For example, `C,300,1` represents a single five-minute section of content.
