# MediaPlayer object lifecycle{#mediaplayer-object-lifecycle}

From the moment that you create the MediaPlayer instance to the moment when you terminate (reuse or remove) it, this instance completes a series of transitions between states.

Some operations are permitted only when the player is in a particular state. For example, calling `play` in `IDLE` is not allowed. You can call this status only after the player reaches the `PREPARED` state.

To work with states:

* You can retrieve the current state of the `MediaPlayer` object with `MediaPlayer.getStatus`.

  ```java
  PlayerState getStatus() throws IllegalStateException;
  ```

* The list of states is defined in `MediaPlayer.PlayerState`.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can use the state to provide feedback on the process (for example, a spinner while waiting for the next state change) or to take the next step in playing the media, such as waiting for the appropriate state before calling the next method.

For example: 

```java
@Override 
public void onStateChanged(MediaPlayer.PlayerState state,  
                           MediaPlayerNotification notification) { 
   switch (state) { 
      // It is recommended that you call prepareToPlay() after receiving  
      // the INITIALIZED state. 
      case INITIALIZED: 
         _mediaPlayer.prepareToPlay(); 
         break; 
      case PREPARING: 
         showBufferingSpinner(); 
         break; 
      case PREPARED: 
         hideBufferingSpinner(); 
      ..... 
    } 
}
```
