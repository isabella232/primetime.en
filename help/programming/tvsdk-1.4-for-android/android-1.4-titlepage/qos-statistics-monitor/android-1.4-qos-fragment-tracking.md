# Track at the fragment level using load information{#track-at-the-fragment-level-using-load-information}

Quality of service (QoS) offers a detailed view into how the video engine is performing. TVSDK provides detailed statistics about playback, buffering, and devices.

TVSDK also provides information about the following downloaded resources:

1. Playlist/manifest files 
1. File fragments 
1. Tracking information for files

   You can read quality of service (QoS) information about downloaded resources, such as fragments and tracks, from the `LoadInfo` class. 

1. Implement the `onLoadInfo` callback event listener.
1. Register the event listener, which TVSDK calls every time a fragment has downloaded.
1. Read the data of interest from the `LoadInfo` parameter that is passed to the callback.
