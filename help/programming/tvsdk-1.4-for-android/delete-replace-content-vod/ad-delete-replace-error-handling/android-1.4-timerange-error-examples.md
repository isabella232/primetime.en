# Time range error examples{#time-range-error-examples}

TVSDK responds to erroneous time range specifications by merging or replacing the time ranges as appropriate.

In the following example, four intersecting DELETE time ranges are defined. TVSDK merges the four time ranges into one, so that the actual delete range is from 0-50s. 

```
"time-ranges": {
    "type": "delete",
    "time-range-list": [ {
        "begin": 10000,
        "end": 35000
    }, {
        "begin": 20000,
        "end": 50000
    }, {
        "begin": 0,
        "end": 30000
    }, {
        "begin": 30000,
        "end": 40000
    } ]
}

```

In the following example, four REPLACE time ranges are defined with conflicting time ranges. In this case, TVSDK replaces 0-50s with 25s of ads. It goes with the first replacement duration in the sort order, because there are conflicts in subsequent ranges. 

```
"time-ranges": {
    "type": "replace",
    "time-range-list": [ {
        "begin": 10000,
        "end": 35000,
        "replace-duration": 15000
    }, {
        "begin": 20000,
        "end": 50000,
        "replace-duration": 20000
    }, {
        "begin": 0,
        "end": 30000,
        "replace-duration": 25000
    }, {
        "begin": 30000,
        "end": 40000,
        "replace-duration": 30000
    } ]
}

```
