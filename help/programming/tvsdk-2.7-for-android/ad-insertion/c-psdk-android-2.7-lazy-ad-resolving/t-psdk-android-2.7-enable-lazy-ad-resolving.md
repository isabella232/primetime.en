# Enable lazy ad resolving {#enable-lazy-ad-resolving}

You can enable or disable the Lazy Ad Resolving feature using the existing Lazy Ad Loading mechanism (Lazy Ad Resolving is enabled by default).

You can enable or disable Lazy Ad Resolving by calling [AdvertisingMetadata.setDelayLoading](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/javadoc_2.4/com/adobe/mediacore/metadata/AdvertisingMetadata.html#setDelayAdLoading-boolean-) with `true` or `false`.

1. Use the Boolean `hasDelayAdLoading` and `setDelayAdLoading` methods in `AdvertisingMetadata` to control the timing of ad resolution and the placement of ads on the timeline:

    * If `hasDelayAdLoading` returns false, TVSDK waits until all ads are resolved and placed before transitioning to the PREPARED state. 
    * If `hasDelayAdLoading` returns true, TVSDK resolves only the initial ads and transitions to the PREPARED state. The remaining ads are resolved and placed during playback. 
    * When `hasPreroll` or `hasLivePreroll` return false, TVSDK assumes that there is no preroll ad and starts the playback of the content immediately. These default to true.

       APIs relevant to lazy ad resolution:     
    
       ```    
       Class: 
          com.adobe.mediacore.metadata.AdvertisingMetadata 
        
       Methods: 
       […] 
           public final boolean hasDelayAdLoading() // Check if Lazy Ad Resolving enabled 
           public final void setDelayAdLoading()    // Enable or disable Lazy Ad Resolving 
           public final boolean hasPreroll()        // Check for existence of pre-roll ads 
           public final void setPreroll()           // Set pre-roll true or false 
           public final boolean hasLivePreroll()    // Check for live pre-roll ads 
           public final void setLivePreroll()       // Set live pre-roll true or false 
       […]
       ```

1. To accurately reflect ads as cues on a scrub bar, listen for the `TimelineEvent` event and redraw the scrub bar every time that you receive this event.

   When Lazy Ad Resolving is enabled for VOD streams, not all ads are placed on the timeline when your player enters the PREPARED state, so your player must explicitly redraw the scrub bar.

   TVSDK optimizes the dispatch of this event to minimize the number of times that you must redraw the scrub bar; therefore, the number of timeline events is not related to the number of ad breaks to be placed on the timeline. For example, if you have five ad breaks, you might not receive exactly five events.

   ```java
   mediaPlayer.addEventListener 
       (MediaPlayerEvent.TIMELINE_UPDATED, timelineUpdatedEventListener); 
   /** 
    * ... 
    */ 
   public void onTimelineUpdated(TimelineEvent event) { 
    
       for (PlaybackManagerEventListener listener : eventListeners) { 
           listener.onUpdate(getLocalSeekRange(), event.getTimeline()); 
       } 
   } 
   
   ```

>To verify whether the Lazy Ad Resolving feature is enabled or disabled, call `AdvertisingMetadata.hasDelayAdLoading`. A return value of `true` means that Lazy Ad Resolving is enabled; `false` means that the feature is disabled.
