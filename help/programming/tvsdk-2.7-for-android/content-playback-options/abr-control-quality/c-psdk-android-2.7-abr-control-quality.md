# Overview {#adaptive-bit-rates-abr-for-video-quality-overview}

HLS and DASH streams provide different bit rate encodings (profiles) for the same short burst of video. TVSDK can select the quality level for each burst based on the current buffering level and the available bandwidth.

 TVSDK constantly monitors the bit rate to ensure that the content is played at the optimal bit rate for the current network connection. You can set the adaptive bit rate (ABR) switching policy and the initial, minimum, and maximum bit rates for a multiple-bit-rate (MBR) stream. TVSDK automatically switches to the bit rate that provides the best playback experience in the specified configuration.

Keep the following information in mind:

* The TVSDK failover mechanism might override your settings, because TVSDK favors a continuous playback experience over strictly adhering to your control parameters. 
* When the bit rate changes, TVSDK dispatches `onProfileChanged` events in `PlaybackEventListener`. 

* You can change your ABR settings at any time, and the player switches to use the profile that most closely matches the most recent settings.

For example, if a stream has the following profiles:

* 1: 300000 
* 2: 700000 
* 3: 1500000 
* 4: 2400000 
* 5: 4000000

If you specify a range of 300000 to 2000000, TVSDK considers only profiles 1, 2 and 3. This allows applications to adjust to various network conditions, such as switching from wi-fi to 3G or to various devices such as a phone, a tablet, or a desktop computer.

To set ABR control parameters, set the parameters on the `ABRControlParameter` class.
