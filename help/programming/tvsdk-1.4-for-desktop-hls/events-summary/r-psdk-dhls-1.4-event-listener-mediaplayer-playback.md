# Playback events{#playback-events}

Your application can monitor the activity in your player and the changing state of the player by listening for events dispatched by TVSDK.

TVSDK dispatches playback events when media playback operations occur, such as a video starting to play. To be notified about all playback-related events, register listeners with the `MediaPlayer` object for the following events.
