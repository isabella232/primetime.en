# Provide volume control{#provide-volume-control}

You can set up a user interface control for sound volume.

1. Wait for the MediaPlayer instance to be in a valid status for this command.

   Any state except for except RELEASED is valid.
1. Call the volume set method on the `MediaPlayer` instance to set the audio volume.

   ```    
   public function set volume(value:Number):void
   ```

   The value for the volume represents the requested volume expressed as a proportion of the maximum volume, where 0 is silent and 1 is the maximum volume.
