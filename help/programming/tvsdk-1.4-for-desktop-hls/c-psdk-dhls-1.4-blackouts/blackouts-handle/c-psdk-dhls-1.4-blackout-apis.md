# Blackout API elements{#blackout-api-elements}

TVSDK provides API elements that are useful when implementing blackouts, including methods, metadata, and notifications.

You can use the following when implementing a blackout solution in your player.

* **MediaPlayer**

    * `registerCurrentItemAsBackgroundItem` Saves the currently loaded resource as the background resource. If `replaceCurrentResource` is called after this method, TVSDK continues to download the background item's manifest until you call `unregisterCurrentBackgroundItem`. 
    
    * `unregisterCurrentBackgroundItem`  Clears the currently set background resource and stops fetching and parsing the background manifest.

* **BlackoutMetadata** A Metadata type that is specific to blackouts.

  This allows you to set nonseekable ranges (an additional `TimeRange` attribute called `nonseekableRange`) on TVSDK. TVSDK checks for these ranges (whether the desired seek position falls within a `nonseekableRange`) every time the user seeks. If it is set and the user seeks into a nonseekable range, TVSDK forces the viewer to the end time of the `seekableRange`. 

* **START HERE NEXT** **DefaultMetadataKeys** Enable or disable preroll on a live stream by setting `ENABLE_LIVE_PREROLL` to true or false. If false, TVSDK does not make an explicit ad server call for pre-roll ads before the content playback and so does not play the pre-roll. This has no impact on the mid-rolls. The default is true. 

* **TimedMetadataEvent**

    * `TIMED_METADATA_IN_BACKGROUND_AVAILABLE` event subtype - Dispatched when TVSDK detects a subscribed tag in the background manifest.

* **Notifications**

    * `BACKGROUND_MANIFEST_WARNING`

        * Code: 204000 
        * Type: Warning 
        * Error in background manifest download.

    * `SeekEvent.SEEK_POSITION_ADJUSTED` Dispatched when a seek is attempted in a nonseekable range.
