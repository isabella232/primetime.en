# TimeRange class{#timerange-class}

Custom ad markers allow you to pass a set of TimeRange specifications that represent timeline segments to TVSDK.

<a id="section_42EB6D62627A424ABA250E3246EFEFC3"></a>

Each `TimeRange` specification in the set represents a segment on the playback timeline that is maintained internally by TVSDK and that must be appropriately marked as an ad-related period.

The `TimeRange` class is a simple data structure that exposes the start position and the end position on the timeline. These two read-only properties abstract the idea of a time range in the playback timeline. 

>[!TIP]
>
>Both values are expressed in milliseconds.

Here is a summary of the TimeRange class: 

```
public final class TimeRange {
    // the start/end values are provided at construction 
    public static function createRange(begin:Number, duration:Number {…}
 
    public function get begin():Number {…}
    public function get end():Number {…}
    public function get duration():Number {…}
}
```
