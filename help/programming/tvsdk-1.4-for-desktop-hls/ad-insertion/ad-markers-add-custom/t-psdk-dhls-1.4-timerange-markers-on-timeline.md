# Place TimeRange ad markers on the timeline{#place-timerange-ad-markers-on-the-timeline}

This example shows the recommended way to include TimeRange specifications on the playback timeline.

1. Translate the out-of-band ad-positioning information into a list of `TimeRange` specifications (that is, instances of the `TimeRange` class).
1. Use the set of `TimeRange` specifications to populate an instance of the `TimeRangeCollection` class.
1. Pass the Metadata instance, which can be obtained from the `TimeRangeCollection` instance, to the `replaceCurrentItem` method (part of the `MediaPlayer` interface).
1. Wait for TVSDK to transition to the PREPARED state by waiting for the `PlaybackEventListener#onPrepared` callback to be triggered.
1. Start video playback by calling the `play()` method (part of the `MediaPlayer` interface).

>* Handling timeline conflicts: There might be cases when some `TimeRange` specifications overlap on the playback timeline. For example, the value of the start position corresponding to a `TimeRange` specification might be lower than the value of the end position that was already placed. In this case, TVSDK silently adjusts the start position of the offending `TimeRange` specification to avoid timeline conflicts. Through this adjustment, the new `TimeRange` becomes shorter than originally specified. If the adjustment is so extreme that it would lead to a `TimeRange` with a duration of zero ms, TVSDK silently drops the offending `TimeRange` specification. 
>* When `TimeRange` specifications for custom ad breaks are provided, TVSDK attempts to translate these into ads that are grouped inside ad breaks. TVSDK looks for adjacent `TimeRange` specifications and clusters them into separate ad breaks. If there are time ranges that are not adjacent to any other time range, they are translated into ad breaks that contain a single ad. 
>* It is assumed that the media player item that is being loaded points to a VOD asset. TVSDK checks this whenever your application tries to load a media resource whose metadata contains `TimeRange` specifications that can be used only in the context of the custom ad-markers feature. If the underlying asset is not of type VOD, TVSDK library throws an exception. 
>* When dealing with custom ad markers, TVSDK deactivates other ad-resolving mechanisms (via Adobe Primetime ad decisioning (previously known as Auditude) or other ad provisioning system). You can use either one of the various ad-resolver modules provided by TVSDK or the custom ad-markers mechanism. When using the custom ad-markers API, the ad content is considered already resolved and placed on the timeline.
