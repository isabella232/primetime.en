# Ad insertion metadata {#ad-insertion-metadata}

To allow the ad resolver to work, ad providers, such as Adobe Primetime ad decisioning, require configuration values to enable your connection to the provider.

TVSDK includes the Primetime ad decisioning library. For your content to include advertising from the Primetime ad decisioning server, your application must provide the following required `AuditudeSettings` information:

* `mediaID`, which is a unique identifier for the video to be played.

  The publisher assigns the mediaID when submitting video content and ad information to the Adobe Primetime ad decisioning server. This ID is used by Primetime ad decisioning to retrieve related advertising information for the video from the server. 

* Your `zoneID`, which is assigned by Adobe, identifies your company or website. 
* The domain of your assigned ad server. 
* Other targeting parameters.

  You can include these parameters depending on your needs and the needs of the ad provider.

## Set up ad insertion metadata {#set-up-ad-insertion-metadata}

Use the helper class AuditudeSettings , which extends the MetadataNode class, to set up Adobe Primetime ad decisioning metadata.

>[!TIP]
>
>Adobe Primetime ad decisioning was previously known as Auditude.

Advertising metadata is in the `MediaResource.metadata` property. When starting the playback of a new video, your application is responsible for setting the correct advertising metadata. 

1. Build the `AuditudeSettings` instance.

   ```
   var auditudeSettings:AuditudeSettings = new AuditudeSettings();
   ```

1. Set the Adobe Primetime ad decisioning mediaID, zoneID, domain, and the optional targeting parameters.

   ```
   auditudeSettings.zoneId = "yourZoneID"; 
   auditudeSettings.mediaId = "media_identifier"; 
   auditudeSettings.domain = "yourAuditudeDomain"; 
   var targetingInfo:Metadata = new Metadata(); 
   targetingInfo.setValue("yourParamName", "yourParamValue"); 
   auditudeSettings.targetingInfo = targetingInfo;
   ```

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The media ID is consumed by TVSDK as a string, that is converted to an md5 value, and is used for the `u` value in the Primetime ad decisioning URL request. For example: 
   >
   >
   >` https://ad.auditude.com/adserver? **u**=c76d04ee31c91c4ce5c8cee41006c97d &z=114100&l=20150206141527&of=1.4&tm=15&g=1000002`

1. Create a `MediaResource` instance by using the media stream URL and the previously created advertising metadata.

   ```
   var mediaResourceMetadata:MetadataNode = new MetadataNode(); 
   mediaResourceMetadata.setNode(DefaultMetadataKeys.AUDITUDE_METADATA_KEY, auditudeSettings); 
   var mediaResource:MediaResource = new MediaResource( 
         "www.example.com/video/test.m3u8", 
         MediaResourceType.HLS,  
         mediaResourceMetadata);
   ```

1. Load the `MediaResource` object through the `MediaPlayer.replaceCurrentResource` method.

   The `MediaPlayer` starts loading and processing the media stream manifest. 

1. (Optional) Query the `MediaPlayerItem` instance to see whether the stream is live, regardless of whether it has alternate audio tracks, or whether the stream is protected.

   This information can help you prepare the UI for the playback. For example, if you know there are two audio tracks, you can include a UI control that toggles between these tracks. 

1. Call `MediaPlayer.prepareToPlay` to start the advertising workflow.

   After the ads have been resolved and placed on the timeline, the `MediaPlayer` transitions to the PREPARED state.
1. Call `MediaPlayer.play` to start the playback.

TVSDK now includes ads when your media plays.
