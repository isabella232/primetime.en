# Default and customized playback behavior with ads{#default-and-customized-playback-behavior-with-ads}

The behavior of media playback is affected by seeking, pausing, and the inclusion of advertising.

To override the default behavior, use `PTAdPolicySelector`.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>For VOD and live/linear streaming, timeline adjustments cannot be revised. This means that an advertisement cannot be removed from the timeline after it has played. If the user seeks back, the same ad plays again even if the normal policy would have been to remove it.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>TVSDK does not provide a way to disable seeking during ads. Adobe recommends that you configure your application to disable seeking during ads.

The following table describes how TVSDK handles ads and ad breaks during playback:
