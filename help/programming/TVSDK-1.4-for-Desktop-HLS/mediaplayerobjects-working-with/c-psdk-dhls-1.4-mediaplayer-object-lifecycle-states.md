# MediaPlayer object lifecycle{#mediaplayer-object-lifecycle}

From the moment that you create the MediaPlayer instance to the moment when you terminate (reuse or remove) it, this instance completes a series of transitions between statuses.

Some operations are permitted only when the player is in a particular state. For example, calling `play` in IDLE is not allowed. You can call this status only after the player reaches the PREPARED state.

To work with statuses:

* You can retrieve the current state of the `MediaPlayer` object by using the `MediaPlayer.status` property.

  ```
  function get status():String;
  ```

* The list of statuses is defined in `MediaPlayer.PlayerStatus`.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can use the status to provide feedback on the process (for example, a spinner while waiting for the next status change) or to take the next step in playing the media, such as waiting for the appropriate status before calling the next method.
