# Load a media resource in the MediaPlayer{#load-a-media-resource-in-the-mediaplayer}

Load a resource by directly instantiating a MediaResource and loading the video content to be played. This is one way of loading a media resource.

1. Set your `MediaPlayer` object's playable item with the new resource to be played.

   Replace your existing MediaPlayer's currently playable item by calling `MediaPlayer.replaceCurrentResource` and passing an existing `MediaResource` instance. 

1. Check for at least the following changes:

    * INITIALIZED 
    * PREPARED 
    * ERROR

       Through these events, the `MediaPlayer` object can notify your application when the media resource is successfully loaded. 
    
1. When the state of the media player changes to INITIALIZED, you can call `MediaPlayer.prepareToPlay`

   The INITIALIZED state indicates that the media has been successfully loaded. Calling `prepareToPlay` starts the advertising resolution and placement process, if any.
1. When the media player status changes to PREPARED, the media stream has successfully loaded and is prepared for playback.

   When the media stream is loaded, a `MediaPlayerItem` is created.
>If a failure occurs, the MediaPlayer switches to the ERROR status. It also notifies your application by dispatching the `STATUS_CHANGED` event to your `MediaPlayerStatusChangeEvent` callback. 
>
>This passes several parameters: >
>* A `type` parameter of type string with the value `ERROR`. 
>
>* A `MediaError` parameter that you can use to get a notification that contains diagnostic information about the error event.
