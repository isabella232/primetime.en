# Create a Browserify-compatible player without the UI-Framework{#create-a-browserify-compatible-player-without-the-ui-framework}

Use the Browserify library file provided by Browser TVSDK in your app, to create a Browserify-compatible player.

The topic [](../../../Browser-TVSDK-2.4/getting-started/c-psdk-browser-tvsdk-2.4-create-a-basic-player/t-psdk-browser-tvsdk-2.4-create-basic-player-tvsdk.md) lists the set of Browser TVSDK libraries that you normally include when you create a basic video player. To do this you simply add `script` tags with `src` attributes pointing to the libraries.

The process is slightly different for creating a Browserify-compatible player. For this, you use the `require` command to include the [!DNL AdobePSDK.module.js] file (provided by the Browser TVSDK) in your app. This file bundles the basic player library files in their proper order of dependency, and returns the `AdobePSDK` namespace you use to implement features for your player.

Browser TVSDK provides the following sample Browserify application and build files in the release package:

* [!DNL […]/samples/browserify/reference/build/Gruntfile.js] 
* [!DNL […]/samples/browserify/reference/build/package.json] 
* [!DNL […]/samples/browserify/reference/examples/sample.html] 
* [!DNL […]/samples/browserify/reference/examples/sample.js]

To create a Browserify-compatible video player: 

1. Require the Browserify-compatible library file that returns the `AdobePSDK` namespace:

   ```
   var AdobePSDK = require('./AdobePSDK.module.js'); 
   var player; 
   function Load () { 
       player = new AdobePSDK.MediaPlayer(); 
   […]
   ```

1. Create your player as described in [](../../../Browser-TVSDK-2.4/getting-started/c-psdk-browser-tvsdk-2.4-create-a-basic-player/t-psdk-browser-tvsdk-2.4-create-basic-player-tvsdk.md).

   Step 1 in this task replaces the step in the basic player instructions in which you source the individual basic player libraries in your app file.
>You can now bundle your app files using Browserify.
