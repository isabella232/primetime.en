# Work with MediaPlayer objects{#work-with-mediaplayer-objects}

The PTMediaPlayer object represents your media player. A PTMediaPlayerItem represents audio or video on your player.

## About the MediaPlayerItem class {#section_B6F36C0462644F5C932C8AA2F6827071}

After a media resource is successfully loaded, TVSDKcreates an instance of the `PTMediaPlayerItem` class to provide access to that resource.

The `PTMediaPlayer` resolves the media resource, loads the associated manifest file, and parses the manifest. This is the asynchronous part of the resource loading process. The `PTMediaPlayerItem` instance is produced after the resource has been resolved, and this instance is a resolved version of a media resource. TVSDK provides access to the newly created `PTMediaPlayerItem` instance through `PTMediaPlayer.currentItem`.

>[!TIP]
>
>You must wait for the resource to be successfully loaded before accessing the media player item.

## MediaPlayer object lifecycle {#section_D87EF7FBC7B442BDBE825156DC2C1CCF}

From the moment that you create the `PTMediaPlayer` instance to the moment when you terminate (reuse or remove) it, this instance completes a series of transitions from one status to another.

Some operations are permitted only when the player is in a particular state. For example, calling `play` in `PTMediaPlayerStatusCreated` is not allowed. You can call this status only after the player reaches the `PTMediaPlayerStatusReady` status.

To work with statuses:

* You can retrieve the current status of the MediaPlayer object with `PTMediaPlayer.status`. 
* The list of statuses is defined in `PTMediaPlayerStatus`.

>You can use the status to provide feedback on the process (for example, a spinner while waiting for the next status change) or to take the next step in playing the media, such as waiting for the appropriate status before calling the next method.
