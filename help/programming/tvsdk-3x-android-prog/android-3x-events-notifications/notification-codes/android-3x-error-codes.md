# PSDK Error Codes {#psdk-error-codes}

Read on to know about PSDK error codes, warnings, and native error codes.

## Errors

The following table provides detailed information about ERROR type notifications. Most errors contain relevant metadata; for example, URL of the resource that failed to download. Some notifications contain metadata to specify whether the problem occurred in the main video content, in the alternate audio content, or in an ad.
