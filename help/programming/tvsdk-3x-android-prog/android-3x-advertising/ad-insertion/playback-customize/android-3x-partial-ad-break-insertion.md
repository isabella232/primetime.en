# Partial Ad break insertion {#partial-ad-break-insertion}

You can enable a TV-like experience of being able to join in the middle of an ad, in live streams. The Partial Ad break feature allows you to mimic a TV-like experience where, if the client starts a live stream inside a midroll, it will start within that midroll. It is similar to switching to a TV channel and the commercials run seamlessly.

For example, If a user joins in the middle of a 90-second ad break (three 30-second ads), 10 seconds into the second ad (that is, at 40 seconds into the ad break), the following happens:

* The second ad is played for the remaining duration (20 sec) followed by the third ad. 
* Ad trackers for the partially played ad (the second ad) are not fired. Only the tracker for the third ad is fired.

The pre-roll ad, if available, is played, and then the content plays from the live point emulating the experience of live television.
