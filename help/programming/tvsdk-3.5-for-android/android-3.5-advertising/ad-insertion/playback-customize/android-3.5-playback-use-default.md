# Use the default playback behavior {#use-the-default-playback-behavior}

You can choose to use default ad behaviors.

1. To use default behaviors, complete one of the following tasks:

    * If you implement your own `AdvertisingFactory` class, return null for `createAdPolicySelector`. 
    
    * If you do not have a custom implementation for the `AdvertisingFactory` class, TVSDK uses a default ad policy selector.

## Set up customized playback {#set-up-customized-playback}

You can customize or override ad behaviors.

Before you can customize or override ad behaviors, register the ad policy instance with . 
To customize ad behaviors, do one of the following:

* Implement the `AdPolicySelector` interface and all its methods.

  This option is recommended if you need to override **all** the default ad behaviors. 

* Extend the `DefaultAdPolicySelector` class and provide implementations for only those behaviors that require customization.

  This option is recommended if you need to override only **some** of the default behaviors.

To customize ad behaviors: 

1. Implement the `AdPolicySelector` interface and all of its methods.
1. Assign the policy instance to be used by TVSDK through the advertising factory.

  >mediaPlayer.replaceCurrentResource(resource, config);
  
  1. Implement your customizations.
