# Primetime player events summary {#primetime-player-events-summary}

Your application can monitor the activity in your player and the changing status of the player by listening for the events that are dispatched by TVSDK.

## Events {#events}

TVSDK notifies you when events, to which your application must respond, occur. Each event corresponds to a listener class, with a callback method that you must implement.
