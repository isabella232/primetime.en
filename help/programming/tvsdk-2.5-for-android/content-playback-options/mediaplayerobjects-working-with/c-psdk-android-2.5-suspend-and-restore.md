# Suspend and Restore MediaPlayer{#suspend-and-restore-mediaplayer}

Suspending and restoring the TVSDK MediaPlayer when a device screen is turned off and on must be handled by your application.

You can handle suspend and restore operations on `MediaPlayer` inside Android's broadcast receiver for screen on/off.

TVSDK can not determine when a Fragment (or Activity) is in the background or foreground. In addition, the Android `SurfaceView` does not get destroyed when the device screen is turned off (but the Activity is paused). However, `SurfaceView` *does* get destroyed when the device puts your application in the background. TVSDK cannot detect any of these changes, so they must be handled by your application.

The following sample code how your application can handle suspending and restoring the `MediaPlayer` when the device screen is turned on and off at the application level:

```java
// Track the state of a fragment to determine if it is PAUSED or RESUMED 
private boolean isActivityPaused = false; 
 
/** 
* Register the broadcast receiver to track screen on/screen off functions triggered from 
device. 
*/ 
private BroadcastReceiver mReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() { 
    @Override 
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { 
 
        // Call suspend when screen is turned off and mediaPlayer is not null and 
        // mediaplayer status is not suspended/Error/Released state. 
        if (intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_OFF)) { 
            try { 
                if (mediaPlayer != null && 
                  lastKnownStatus != MediaPlayerStatus.ERROR && 
                  lastKnownStatus != MediaPlayerStatus.RELEASED && 
                  lastKnownStatus != MediaPlayerStatus.SUSPENDED) { 
                    PrimetimeReference.logger.i(LOG_TAG+"#screenOff:", 
                    "Suspending mediaplayer as screen is turned off and mediaPlayer 
                    status is " + lastKnownStatus.toString()); 
                    mediaPlayer.suspend(); 
                } 
                else { 
                    PrimetimeReference.logger.i(LOG_TAG+"#screenOff:", 
                      "Not suspending mediaplayer since mediaplayer status is " 
                      + lastKnownStatus.toString()); 
                } 
            } catch(MediaPlayerException e) { 
                PrimetimeReference.logger.e(LOG_TAG+"#screenOff:", 
                  "MediaPlayer Exception for suspend() call"); 
            } 
        } 
        else if (intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_ON)) { 
            // Call restore when the screen is turned on and mediaplayer is not in the  
            // suspended status.  This is for the screen on condition when the device  
            // does not have a lock and turning on the screen immediately brings the  
            // fragment to the foreground. 
            try { 
                if(lastKnownStatus == MediaPlayerStatus.SUSPENDED && !isActivityPaused) { 
                    PrimetimeReference.logger.i(LOG_TAG+"#screenOn:", 
                      "Restoring mediaplayer since screen is turned on and mediaPlayer status is " 
                      + lastKnownStatus.toString());
