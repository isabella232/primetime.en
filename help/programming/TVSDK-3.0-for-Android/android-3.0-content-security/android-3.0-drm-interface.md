# Primetime DRM interface overview{#primetime-drm-interface-overview}

The key client-side element of the Primetime DRM solution is the DRM Manager. The sample application that is included with the Android SDK also includes a DRMHelper class that can be used to make certain DRM operations easier to implement.

Primetime DRM provides a scalable, efficient workflow to implement content protection in TVSDK applications. You protect and manage the rights to your video content by creating a license for each digital media file.

For more information, see the DRM sample player code that is included in the TVSDK package.

Here are the most important API elements for working with DRM:

* A reference in the media player to the DRM manager object that implements the DRM subsystem: 

  ```java
  MediaPlayer.getDRMManager();
  ```

  >[!TIP]
  >
  >This API will return a valid `DRMManager` object only after the `MediaPlayerEvent.DRM_METADATA` is fired. If you call `getDRMManager()` before this event fires, it might return NULL.

* The `DRMHelper` helper class, which is useful when implementing DRM workflows. 
* A `DRMHelper` metadata loader method, which loads DRM metadata when it is located in a separate URL from the media. 

  ```java
  public static void loadDRMMetadata(final DRMManager drmManager,  
     final String drmMetadataUrl,  
     final DRMLoadMetadataListener loadMetadataListener);
  ```

* A `DRMHelper` method to check the DRM metadata and determine whether authentication is required. 

  ```java
  /** 
  * Return whether authentication is needed for the provided 
  * DRMMetadata. 
  * 
  * @param drmMetadata 
  * The desired DRMMetadata on which to check whether auth is needed. 
  * @return whether authentication is required for the provided metadata 
  */ 
  public static boolean isAuthNeeded(DRMMetadata drmMetadata);
  ```

* `DRMHelper` method to perform authentication. 

  ```java
  /** 
  * Helper method to perform DRM authentication. 
  * 
  * @param drmManager 
  * the DRMManager, used to perform the authentication. 
  * @param drmMetadata 
  * the DRMMetadata, containing the DRM specific information. 
  * @param authenticationListener 
  * the listener, on which the user can be notified about the 
  * authentication process status. 
  * @param authUser 
  * the DRM username provider by the user. 
  * @param authPass 
  * the DRM password provided by the user. 
  */ 
  public static void performDrmAuthentication(final DRMManager drmManager,  
  final DRMMetadata drmMetadata,  
  final String authUser,  
  final String authPass,  
  final DRMAuthenticationListener authenticationListener);
  ```

* Events that notify your application about various DRM activities and status.
