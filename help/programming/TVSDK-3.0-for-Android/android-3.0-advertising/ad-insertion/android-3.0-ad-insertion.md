To incorporate ads in your video content, ensure that the advertising and main video content meets the following requirements:

* The advertising content's HLS version cannot be higher than the main content's HLS version. 
* Ads do not have to be multiplexed (with no restrictions), regardless of whether the main content is multiplexed.
