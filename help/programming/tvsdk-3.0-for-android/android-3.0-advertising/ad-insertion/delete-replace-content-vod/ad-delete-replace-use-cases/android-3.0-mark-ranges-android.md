# Mark ranges{#mark-ranges}

You can designate time intervals in VOD content as ad breaks.

The `TimeRanges` between the `begin` and `end` in `localTime` will be marked as an `AdBreak` in the timeline. Other ad settings are ignored.

>[!TIP]
>
>If you want to only mark certain ranges in the content as ads, with no dynamic ad insertion, create a `CustomRangeMetadata` instance, and specify the type as a `MARK` operation with the defined custom ranges.

1. Tp mark the ranges:
