# Ad deletion and replacement API changes

**New APIs** 

* `PTTimeRangeCollection` is a public class that defines a predefined set of ranges and a type: 
    * `property PTTimeRangeCollectionType type` indicates the type of time range.
    * `property NSArray* ranges` is used to set the time ranges. The expected type of objects in the array are `PTReplacementTimeRange` or `CMTimeRange`. 

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >All the objects of the array must be the same type.

    * `PTTimeRangeCollectionType` is an enum that defines the behavior for the ranges that are defined in the `PTTimeRangeCollection`:     
        * `PTTimeRangeCollectionTypeMarkRanges`: The type of the ranges is *Mark*. The ranges are used for marking the ranges in the content as Ads.
        * `PTTimeRangeCollectionTypeDeleteRanges`: The type of the ranges is Delete. The defined ranges are removed from the main content before ad insertion.
        * `PTTimeRangeCollectionTypeReplaceRanges`: The type of the ranges is Replace. The defined ranges are replaced from the main with Ads (Ad signaling mode is set to `PTAdSignalingModeCustomTimeRanges`).


* `PTReplacementTimeRange` - New public class that defines a single range of the `PTTimeRangeCollection`: 
    * `property CMTimeRange range` - Defines the start and duration of the range.
    * `property long replacementDuration` - If the type of the `TimeRangeCollection` is `PTTimeRangeCollectionTypeReplaceRanges`, the `replacementDuration` is used to create a placement opportunity (ad insertion) with a duration of `replacementDuration`. If the `replacementDuration` is not set, the ad server will determine the duration and number of ads for that placement opportunity.

* `PTAdSignalingMode`: 
    * `PTAdSignalingModeCustomTimeRanges` - Added a new type of `PTAdSignalingMode`. This mode is used in conjunction with the `PTTimeRangeCollection` with type `PTTimeRangeCollectionReplace` for ad insertion based on the replacement ranges.

* `PTAdMetadata`: 
    * `property PTTimeRangeCollection* timeRangeCollection` - For setting the time ranges used in the mark/delete/replace ranges in the playback content.

* Warning logs: 
    * `UNDEFINED_TIME_RANGES`     
        * Type - Warning
        * Description - The ad signaling mode is defined as custom ranges but the custom ranges are not defined.

    * `INVALID_TIME_RANGES`     
        * Type - Warning
        * Description - One or more time ranges are invalid and will be ignored or modified.


**Deprecated APIs** 

* `PTAdMetadata`: 
    * `property NSArray* externalAdRanges` - This property was previously used to define C3 ranges for marking. It is now deprecated, as these ranges are set via `PTTimeRangeCollection`.
