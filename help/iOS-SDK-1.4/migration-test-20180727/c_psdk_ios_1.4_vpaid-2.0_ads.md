# VPAID 2.0 ad support

The following features are supported: 
* Version 2.0 of the VPAID specification For more information, refer to [IAB VPAID 2.0](http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VPAID_2_0_Final_04-10-2012.pdf). 

* Linear VPAID ads on video-on-demand (VOD) content
* JavaScript VPAID ads VPAID ads must be JavaScript-based, and the ad response must identify the media type of the VPAID ad as `application/javascript`. 


The following features are not supported: 
* Version 1.0 of the VPAID specification
* Skippable ads
* Nonlinear ads such as overlay ads, dynamic companion ads, minimizable ads, collapsible ads, and expandable ads
* Preloading VPAID ads
* VPAID ads in live content
* Flash VPAID ads
* Post-roll VPAID ad


## API Changes {#section_D62F3E059C6C493592D34534B0BFC150}

The following changes were made to the API: 
* `PTAuditudeMetadata` has a `customAdLoadTimeout` property to change the default timeout on the VPAID loading process. The default timeout value is 10 seconds.

* `PTMediaPlayerCustomAdNotification` is dispatched from the `PTMediaPlayer` instance

While the VPAID ad is playing: 
* The VPAID ad is displayed in a view container above the player view, so the code that relies on taps by users on the player view does not work.
* The main content player is paused, and calls to `pause` and `play` on the player instance are used to pause and resume the VPAID ad.
* VPAID ads do not have a predefined duration, because the ad can be interactive. The ad duration and total ad break duration that are defined by the ad server response might not be accurate.
