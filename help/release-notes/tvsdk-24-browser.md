The following features are new in version 2.4.7:

• Addition of the UI Configurator in the UI Framework

You can configure the player in one of the following ways:

• Using a JSON object

• Using APIs

To help generate the JSON object, Browser TVSDK provides a **UI Configurator **tool.

In this tool, you can select various settings, click **Test Configuration **to verify the settings, and click **Download Configuration **to download the settings. After downloading the file, you can pass the contents of this file as JSON object, to the ptp.videoPlayer API.

• Addition of the MediaPlayerItemConfig API to the UI Framework

Various features, including advertisingMetadata, advertisingFactory, adSignalingMode, networkConfiguration, customRangeMetadata, useHardwareDecoder, subscribeTags, adTags, thumbnailScrubber, billingMetricsConfiguration, can be configured through MediaPlayerItemConfig. For more information, see the AdobePSDK.MediaPlayerItemConfig documentation in the [Browser TVSDK API](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/browser_tvsdk/index.html)* * [documentation](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/browser_tvsdk/index.html).

In the UI Framework, the way of passing network configurations through the player configuration has been modified.

#### Version 2.4.6 {#version}

`var player = ptp.videoPlayer(‘#videoHolder’, {`

`player: {`

`networkConfiguration: <network configuration object>`

`}`

`};`

#### Version 2.4.7 {#version-1}

`var player = ptp.videoPlayer(‘#videoHolder’, {`

`player: {`

`mediaPlayerItemConfig: {`

`networkConfiguration: <network configuration object>`

`}`

`}`

`};`

* Support for DRM and Analytics workflows in the UI Framework

DRM configurations and Analytics Tracking can be enabled through the UI Framework.

* Addition of `AdobePSDK.embedSWFinFullScreenDiv` API

This new API provides flexibility to the player app for selecting the div in which it can embed the FlashFallback.swf file.

* Replaced `getVersion`API from `AdobePSDK.MediaPlayer` class with `AdobePSDK.Version` class for TVSDK version related information. For details, see `AdobePSDK.Version` API [here](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/browser_tvsdk/AdobePSDK.Version.html).

**Version 2.4.6**

The following features are new in version 2.4.6:

* **Browserify Support**

Browserify allows you to use the node.js style modules in the browser. You can define the dependencies and Browserify bundles everything into one JavaScript file.

* **Billing**

With the help of billing, Browser TVSDK can collect player usage metrics to bill Primetime customers.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The deprecated enum MediaPlayer.Events and deprecated constants in Enum PSDKErrorCode have been removed in version 2.4.6. For more information, see [Converting from Browser TVSDK 2.4.5 to version 2.4.6](https://helpx.adobe.com/primetime/conversion-guides/browser-tvsdk-245-to-246-for-javascript.html).

**Version 2.4.5**

The following features are new in version 2.4.5:

* **Full Event Replays and Ads** 

  HLS Full Event Replay (FER) streams now supports ad resolution and ad behaviors. To enable this support, set the ad signaling mode to `MANIFEST_CUES` when creating the `MediaPlayerItemConfig` object.

* **MediaplayerView ScalePolicy Support**
  
  Application developers can now specify a different scalePolicy for the view using MediaplayerView scalePolicy property.

* **Anamorphic Content Support**

  Anamorphic content playback is now supported when using MSE and Flash playback.

* **Selective application of `withCredentials`**

When `withCredentials` is set to true, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header cannot be set to a wild card. Depending on the response of server, Browser TVSDK will selectively set the `withCredentials` attribute. For more information about this support, see [Browser TVSDK API docs](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/browser_tvsdk/index.html).

**Version 2.4.4**

The following features were new in version 2.4.4:

* **Chromecast sample app**

This release provides support for a sender and receiver app that demonstrates playback of DASH VOD streams and DASH Widevine streams with client side ad insertion.

* **Advanced failover support**

This release contains support for advanced failover use cases (segment and server failover) for HLS VOD streams.

**Version 2.4.3**

The following features were new in version 2.4.3:

* **Custom tags for DASH VOD**

  Inline custom tags (Events) can be subscribed to and received as TimedMetadata object.

* **Playback of streams without extensions**

  HLS and DASH streams without extensions are now supported. For the manifest file, the resourceType needs to be specified when loading the resource. For segments and VTT files, the Content-Type response header is used to determine the content type.

**Version 2.4.2**

The following features were new in version 2.4.2:

* **API Parity**

For a complete list of the API parity, see the [TVSDK for 1.4 DHLS to Browser TVSDK 2.4 Migration Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/primetime/migration-guides/tvsdk-14-dhls-browser-tvsdk-24.html).

* **Sample-AES support**

  This release adds support for Sample-AES encrypted content playback on MSE and Flash fallback. The requirement to host AES content over secure origin on Google Chrome have been removed.

* **Support for AAC containers**

  The playback of files with the .aac extension is now supported. This can be audio-only streams or alternate audio.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >AC3 and enhanced AC3 codecs are not yet supported.

* **Tokenized stream playback**

HLS streams that are delivered through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) can sometimes use authentication tokens on the manifest and segment requests for verification, and these tokens can be provided as URL parameters or as cookie headers. The playback of such streams are now supported.

**Version 2.4.1**

The following features were new in version 2.4.1:

* **UI framework**

This framework, designed to accelerate UI development for JavaScript-based video player applications, consists of APIs for including basic controls like play/pause and volume and for easily adding or removing elements like scrub bar states and closed caption settings. You can specify the behavior associated with controls, create custom controls, and skin the player UI. This all happens through the framework, with no need for manipulating the DOM structure directly.

* **HLS playback enhancements for Live streams**

This release supports discontinuities caused by ad insertion. It uses the EXT-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag followed by the EXT-MEDIA-SEQUENCE tag to synchronize across adaptive bitrate profiles for smooth playback.

* **VPAID 2.0 support**

The video player ad-serving interface definition (VPAID), version 2.0, provides a rich media experience for users and allows publishers to better target ads, track ad impressions, and monetize video content. This release supports linear JavaScript VPAID ads for video-on-demand (VOD) content.

* **Custom HLS tags**

Media streams can carry additional metadata in the form of tags in the playlist/manifest file. Browser TVSDK lets you specify and subscribe to additional tags and be notified when those tags appear in the manifest.

* **Ad markers displayed on the player timeline**

This release supports showing ad markers on the player timeline for both VOD and Live content. You can see this behavior in the reference player.

#### Supported in 2.4 {#supported-in}

The following features were available in version 2.4:

* **MP3 audio playback**

  This release supports MP3 audio playback on browsers with Media Source Extensions (MSE) and with the Safari video tag.

* **MP4 video playback**
