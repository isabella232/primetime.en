# Default and customized playback behavior with ads

To override the default behavior, use `codeph AdBreakPolicySelector` .


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>does not provide a way to disable seeking during ads. Adobe recommends that you configure your application to disable seeking during ads.

Here is the playback behavior for live/linear content:
* Resuming playback after a pause results in the playback of the content that was buffered at the time of the pause.
  If the resuming position is still in the playback range, the playback should be continuous. Otherwise,  jumps to the new live point. You can also perform a seek operation and select a different playback point.
  
  
* resolves ads between cues after the position at which the application enters live playback.
  Playback begins after the first cue is resolved. The default value for entering live playback is the client live point, but you can choose a different position. All cues before the initial position are resolved after the application performs a seek in the DVR window.
  
  

The following table describes how  handles ads and ad breaks during playback:
