# Implement fast forward and rewind

To switch the speed, you must set one value.

>1. Move from normal play mode (1x) to trick play mode by setting the rate on the `codeph  MediaPlayer` to an allowed value.
>   Remember the following information:
>* The `codeph  MediaPlayerItem` class defines the allowed playback rates.
>* selects the closest allowed rate if the specified rate is not allowed.
>   
>   The following example sets the player's internal playback rate to the requested rate:
>   ```
>   import com.adobe.mediacore.MediaPlayer; 
>   import com.adobe.mediacore.MediaPlayerItem; 
>   import com.adobe.mediacore.MediaPlayerException; 
>   import java.util.List; 
>   import java.lang.Float; 
>    
>   private boolean setPlaybackRate(MediaPlayer player, float rate) 
>    throws MediaPlayerException { 
>    // Get list of playback rates that the media player supports 
>    MediaPlayerItem item = player.getCurrentItem(); 
>    if (item == null) return false; 
>    List&lt;Float&gt; availableRates = player.getCurrentItem().getAvailablePlaybackRates(); 
>    
>    // Return false if requested rate is not supported 
>    if (availableRates.indexOf(rate) == -1) return false; 
>    
>    // Otherwise set the playback rate to the requested rate 
>    // (this can throw MediaPlayerException) 
>    player.setRate(rate); 
>    return true; 
>   }
>   ```
>

>1. You can optionally listen for rate-change events, which notifies you when you requested a rate change and when the rate change actually occurs.
>   dispatches the following events that are related to trick play:
>* `codeph  MediaPlayerEvent.RATE_SELECTED`, when the `codeph  rate` value changes to a different value.
>* `codeph  MediaPlayerEvent.RATE_PLAYING`, when playback resumes at the selected rate.
>   dispatches these events when the player returns from trick play mode to normal play mode.
