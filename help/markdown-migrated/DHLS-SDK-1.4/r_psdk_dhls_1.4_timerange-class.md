Each `codeph TimeRange` specification in the set represents a segment on the playback timeline that is maintained internally by  and that must be appropriately marked as an ad-related period.

The `codeph TimeRange` class is a simple data structure that exposes the start position and the end position on the timeline. These two read-only properties abstract the idea of a time range in the playback timeline.
>[!TIP]
>
>Both values are expressed in milliseconds.

Here is a summary of the TimeRange class:
```
public final class TimeRange {
 // the start/end values are provided at construction 
 public static function createRange(begin:Number, duration:Number {…}
 
 public function get begin():Number {…}
 public function get end():Number {…}
 public function get duration():Number {…}
}
```
