# Implement custom time updates

>[!TIP]
>
>Override this method only if you want to provide a different playhead position than the default position.
>1. To override the default playhead position:
>   ```
>   vaMetadata.currentTimeUpdateBlock = function():Number { 
>    if (currentTime == 0) { 
>    currentTime = getTimer(); 
>    } 
>    return ((getTimer() - currentTime) / 1000 + 1000); 
>   }
>   ```
>   >[!IMPORTANT]
>   >
>   >The values in this code snippet are only samples. You need to use different values for your custom playhead position.
