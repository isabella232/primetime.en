# Enable lazy ad loading

>1. Use the Boolean property `codeph  delayAdLoading` in `codeph  AdvertisingMetadata`.
>* When false,  waits until all ads are resolved and placed before transitioning to the PREPARED status. It is false by default.
>* When true,  resolves only the initial ads and transitions to the PREPARED status. The remaining ads are resolved and placed during playback.
>   
>   
>1. To also activate delayed ad loading with , set this to `codeph  true` when you create `codeph  AuditudeSettings`.
>   The`codeph  AuditudeSettings` class inherits this property from `codeph  AdvertisingMetadata`, but does not inherit the current value.
>       
>       ```
>       var auditudeSettings:AuditudeSettings = new AuditudeSettings(); 
>       auditudeSettings.mediaId = ... 
>       auditudeSettings.zoneId = ... 
>       auditudeSettings.delayAdLoading = true;
>       ```
>

>1. To accurately reflect ads as cues on a scrub bar, listen for the `codeph  TimelineEvent`. `codeph  TIMELINE_UPDATED` event and redraw the scrub bar every time that you receive this event.
>   When VoD streams use delayed ad loading, not all ads are placed on the timeline when your player enters the PREPARED status, so you must explicitly redraw the scrub bar.
>   optimizes the dispatch of this event to minimize the number of times that you must redraw the scrub bar; therefore, the number of timeline events is not related to the number of ad breaks to be placed on the timeline. For example, if you have five ad breaks, you might not receive exactly five events.
