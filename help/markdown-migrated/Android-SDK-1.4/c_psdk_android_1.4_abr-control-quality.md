# Adaptive bit rates (ABR) for video quality

constantly monitors the bit rate to ensure that the content is played at the optimal bit rate for the current network connection.

You can set the adaptive bit-rate (ABR) switching policy and the initial, minimum, and maximum bit rates for a multiple-bit-rate (MBR) stream.  automatically switches to the bit rate that provides the best playback experience in the specified configuration.

Keep the following information in mind:
* The  failover mechanism might override your settings, because  favors a continuous playback experience over strictly adhering to your control parameters.
* When the bit rate changes,  dispatches `codeph onProfileChanged` events in `codeph PlaybackEventListener`.
* You can change your ABR settings at any time, and the player switches to use the profile that most closely matches the most recent settings.

For example, if a stream has the following profiles:
* 1: 300000
* 2: 700000
* 3: 1500000
* 4: 2400000
* 5: 4000000
If you specify a range of 300000 to 2000000, considers only profiles 1, 2 and 3. This allows applications to adjust to various network conditions, such as switching from wi-fi to 3G or to various devices such as a phone, a tablet, or a desktop computer.

To set ABR control parameters, set the parameters on the `codeph ABRControlParameter` class.
